C. Translation
Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.

Chaos was the first god. His daughters, Nox and Terra, were the mother of all man. These were the mothers of Mors and Letum. Their children were horrible monsters: Typhon, Python, and the Cyclopes. Typhon and Python were huge dragons and the Cyclopes were foolish stoneworkers. However, their brother Uranus was the first king of the gods himself. He was strong and large, but rational.
