Chaos was the first god. She was the daughter of Nox and Terra, mother of all man. These were the mothers of Mors and Letum. Those sons were horrible monsters: Typhon, Python, and Cyclopes. Typhon and Python* were huge dragons and Cyclopes was a foolish stoneworker. However, their brother Uranus was the first real god of the kingdom. This place was strong and large, but rational.
