C. Translation
Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.

Chaos was the first god. His **(why did you choose feminine?)** daughters, Nox and Terra, were the mother of all man. These **(who? how many?)** were the mothers of Mors and Letum. His **(what form is *illius*?)** children were horrible monsters: Typhon, Python, and Cyclopes. Typhon and Python were huge dragons and Cyclops **(what number is *Cyclopes*?)** was a foolish stoneworker. However, their brother Uranus was the first **(what does *ipse* mean?)** god of the kingdom himself. This kingdom **(What does *hic* refere to?)** was strong and large, but rational.
