C. Translation
Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.

Chaos was the first god. She **(why did you choose feminine?)** was the daughter of Nox and Terra, mother of all man. These **(who? how many?)** were the mothers of Mors and Letum. Those **(what form is *illius*?)** sons were horrible monsters: Typhon, Python, and Cyclopes. Typhon and Python* were huge dragons and Cyclopes **(what number is *Cyclopes*?)** was a foolish stoneworker. However, their brother Uranus was the first real **(what does *ipse* mean?)** god of the kingdom. This place **(What does *hic* refere to?)** was strong and large, but rational.
