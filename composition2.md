**Needs revisions**

Use each of the following names or nouns at least once:
Prometheus, Prometheī, m. - Prometheus
aquila, aquilae, f. - eagle
cor, cordis, n. - heart
Hercules, Herculis m. - Hercules
Your first sentence must use the verb “to seize” to express the idea that Prometheus stole fire from the gods.
Your second sentence should express that Prometheus gave fire to all of mankind using a direct object and an indirect object.
Your third sentence should express that the gods punished Prometheus for this act using a passive verb and an ablative of agent.
Your fourth sentence should express that an eagle attacked Prometheus’ heart and use a genitive of possession.
Your fifth sentence should express that Hercules killed the eagle and use a demonstrative.
You must use at least two verbs in the imperfect tense and two verbs in the perfect tense.
You must use at least two verbs in the passive voice.
You must use at least one personal pronoun


Prometheus capiebat ignis ab dis. **1) What case is *ignis*?  2) What form is *dis*?  3) *capiebat* is the correct form of the imperfect tense.  Why did you choose that rather than perfect?**
Prometheus ducebat ignis ab omnibus hominibus. **1) To give = "do, dare, dedi, datus".  2) In the English sentence "Prometheus gave fire to mankind", what is the grammatical function of "fire" and "to mankind"?**
Deum poenas Prometheus hoc actum.  **Where is subject, verb and direct object in this sentence?**
Aquila petebat cordis Promethei. **What case is *cordis*?**
Hercules interficiebat aquila.  **What case is *aquila*?  You again have the correct form of the imperfect tense, but I'm curious why you chose imperfect rather than perfect.**
