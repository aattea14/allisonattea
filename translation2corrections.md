Long ago, Prometheus, the first son of Iapetus, was fashioning men out of mud. Simultaneously, Vulcan was creating a woman out of mud. Minerva gave a soul to this woman and sent gifts to her for all the gods. Hence the name "Pandora" was given to her. Pandora was given by Jupiter to Epimetheus in marriage. Their daughter was Pyrrha, the first mortal.
