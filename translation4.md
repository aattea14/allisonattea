Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.

When the Greeks were not able to seize Troy for 10 years, Epeus made a wooden horse of amazing size. 
For that reason they gathered Menelaus, Ulixes, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamus, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus. Also, written on the horse was "Greek Minerva Give Gift", the military camp was carried over to Tenedos. When the Trojans considered, he judged the enemy to go away; Minervae led the horse Priamus ordered into the temple. When the prophet, Cassandra, said the horse to have enemies, he was given no faith, and the horse was placed on behalf of the temple. The Greeks went out of the gates, guards were killed, and the Trojans were conquered.
