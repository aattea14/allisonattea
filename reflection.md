Your reflection should consider what you have learned about the intersection of Latin and structures of power, and how this relates to larger attempts to create a more just society. You could refer specifically to our discussions of gender and pronouns, how the passive voice and attributions of agency relate to power, the limited access of classics to students of color, and the “dark side of the subjunctive,” and more generally could discuss any ways your exposure to Latin this semester has given you a different perspective on language or specifically on English.
