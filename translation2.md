Please translate the passage into idiomatic English.

Long ago, Prometheus, the first son of Iapeti, was a man fashioned out of mud. Simultaneously, Vulcan created a woman out of mud. Minerva gave a soul to this woman and sent each god a gift. Hence the name "Pandora" was given to her. By Jupiter, Pandora was given by Jupiter to Epimetheus in marriage. Her daughter was Pyrrha, the first mortal.
