C. Translation

Erechteus, the son of Pandion, had four daughters. At that time, Eumolpus, son of Neptune, came to Athens which is to be attacked (**review this phrase after you have revised the question above about what the gerundive experesses.**), but he was defeated. Neptune, angry because the son was killed by Erechtheo (**What case is *Erectheo*?  What does the phrase *ab Erechteo* express with a passive verb?**), said "the daughter must be sacrificed by Erecthei. (**Here, too:  review the meaning of the gerundive.  You've translated this as though he's stating a fact.**)" Therefore Chthonia, one of her daughters (**What case is *filiarum*?**), was sacrificed (**Check vocabulary for *immolata*!**). The other sisters killed themselves, Erechtheus himself was hit by lightening.
