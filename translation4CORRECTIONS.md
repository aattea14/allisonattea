When the Greeks were not able to seize Troy for 10 years, Epeus made a wooden horse of amazing size.
In it were gathered Menelaus, Ulixes, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamus, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus. Also, on the horse they wrote "The Greeks Give a Gift to Minerva", and the military camp was brought to Tenedos. When the Trojans saw it, they thought that the enemy had gone away; Priamus ordered that the horse be led into the temple of Minerva. When the prophet, Cassandra, said the horse to have enemies, they did not believe her and the horse was placed in front of the temple. The Greeks went out of the gate and they killed the guards and conquered Troy.
