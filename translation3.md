C. Translation

Erechteus, the son of Pandion, had four daughters. At that time, Eumolpus, son of Neptune, came to attack Athens, but he was defeated. Neptune, angry because the son was killed by Erechtheus, said "the daughter of Erecthei must be sacrificed." Therefore Chthonia, one of the daughters, was sacrificed. The other sisters killed themselves, Erechtheus himself was hit by lightening.
